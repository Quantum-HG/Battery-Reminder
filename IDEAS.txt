Here's a comprehensive list of features for your battery management app, focusing on functionalities that will be most useful for users:

### Dashboard
- **Battery Percentage Display**: Real-time display of the current battery percentage.
- **Battery Status**: Show whether the battery is charging, discharging, or fully charged.
- **Time Remaining**: Estimate and display the remaining time to full charge or discharge.
- **Power Source**: Indicate whether the device is plugged in or running on battery power.

### Battery Health
- **Battery Wear Level**: Display the wear level of the battery over time.
- **Battery Capacity**: Show the current full charge capacity versus the design capacity.
- **Charge Cycles**: Display the number of charge cycles the battery has gone through.
- **Battery Report**: Generate a detailed battery health report using `powercfg /batteryreport`.

### Alerts and Notifications
- **Custom Battery Percentage Alerts**: Allow users to set custom alerts for specific battery percentages (e.g., alert at 80%).
- **Low Battery Alerts**: Notify users when the battery level is critically low.
- **Full Charge Alerts**: Notify users when the battery is fully charged to prevent overcharging.
- **Custom Ringtones**: Allow users to set custom ringtones for different alerts.

### Settings
- **Alert Configuration**: Provide options to configure when and how alerts are displayed (e.g., sound, popup, email).
- **Power Plan Management**: Allow users to switch between different power plans (e.g., Balanced, Power Saver, High Performance) and create custom power plans.
- **Brightness Control**: Provide controls to adjust screen brightness.
- **Powercfg Commands**: Execute various powercfg commands directly from the app (e.g., `powercfg /energy`, `powercfg /requests`).

### Additional Features
- **System Tray Integration**: Minimize the app to the system tray and provide quick access to key features from the tray icon.
- **Sleep Study**: Generate a sleep study report using `powercfg /sleepstudy`.
- **Device Query**: List devices that can wake the system or have specific power management capabilities using `powercfg /devicequery`.
- **Energy Efficiency Diagnostics**: Run and display results from the `powercfg /energy` command to identify and troubleshoot power efficiency issues.
- **Battery Saving Tips**: Provide tips and suggestions for extending battery life.
- **Auto Updates**: Check for and apply updates automatically.

### Implementation Details
- **Execute Commands with Admin Privileges**: Use a function like `executeCommandWithAdmin` to run necessary commands that require elevated privileges.
- **Parse HTML Reports**: Parse HTML reports generated by powercfg commands and display them within the app.
- **Store Settings**: Save user settings and preferences in a JSON file for easy access and modification by both the UI and background processes.
- **System Information**: Display detailed system information, including battery manufacturer, model, and serial number, using Windows API or WMI.

### Example Implementation for Key Features
#### Custom Battery Percentage Alerts
```cpp
void checkBatteryPercentage(float currentPercentage, float alertPercentage) {
    if (currentPercentage >= alertPercentage) {
        // Code to show alert
        std::wcout << L"Battery is at " << currentPercentage << L"%!" << std::endl;
        // Play alert sound or show notification
    }
}
```

#### Execute Powercfg Commands
```cpp
void runPowercfgCommand(const std::wstring& command) {
    executeCommandWithAdmin(L"powercfg " + command);
}

// Usage
runPowercfgCommand(L"/batteryreport");
```

#### Display Battery Health Information
```cpp
void displayBatteryHealth() {
    // Fetch and display battery health information
    // For example, using WMI to get battery capacity and charge cycles
}
```

This list includes a mix of basic and advanced features that can provide significant value to users by helping them monitor and manage their battery usage effectively. The implementation details give you a starting point for adding these features to your app.
